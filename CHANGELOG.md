### Added

- docs: CLAUDE.md updated for state machine workflow model (4775637)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Async orchestration loop polling Linear for issues in configurable states

- Rich terminal UI with persistent status bar and single-key controls
- Jinja2 prompt templates with full issue context
- `.env` auto-load and `$VAR` env references in config
