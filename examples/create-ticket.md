# Create Ticket

Guide the user through creating a well-structured Linear ticket with acceptance criteria and implementation context, ready for agent execution.

## Process

### Step 1: Get the ticket

Ask the user:
> What's the Linear ticket identifier? (e.g., ENG-42)
> If you haven't created one yet, create a blank ticket in Linear first and give me the identifier.

Once you have the identifier, use the Linear MCP tool to fetch the current ticket details (title, description, labels, priority).

### Step 2: Understand the goal

If the ticket already has a description, read it and summarise your understanding back to the user. Ask if anything is missing.

If the ticket has no description or a minimal one, ask these questions one at a time (wait for each answer before asking the next):

1. **What are we building?** — Describe the feature, fix, or change in one sentence.
2. **Why?** — What problem does this solve or what value does it add?
3. **Where in the codebase?** — Which areas, packages, or apps are affected?
4. **Are there designs?** — Figma links, screenshots, or visual references?
5. **Are there dependencies?** — Does this depend on other tickets? Any API changes needed?
6. **What's out of scope?** — What is explicitly NOT included in this ticket?

### Step 3: Research and context

Based on the answers, do targeted research in the codebase:
- Read relevant existing code that will be modified
- Check for related documentation, specs, or decision records
- Look at similar completed work for patterns to follow

Summarise what you found and confirm the approach with the user.

### Step 4: Generate acceptance criteria

Based on the conversation, generate a structured acceptance criteria JSON block:

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    { "description": "Description of what must be true", "verified": false },
    { "description": "Another requirement", "verified": false }
  ]
}
```

Guidelines for good criteria:
- Each criterion is independently verifiable — one thing, not compound statements
- Include both functional requirements (what it does) and quality requirements (tests, types, architecture)
- Always include: typecheck/build passes with no errors
- Always include: all existing tests pass
- If UI changes: include design accuracy and accessibility criteria
- If new logic: include "Unit tests cover the new logic"
- Prefer "X renders correctly at mobile breakpoint" over "X looks good" — be specific

Present the criteria to the user for review. Add, remove, or modify based on feedback.

### Step 5: Generate the ticket description

Compose a structured ticket description in this format:

```markdown
## Summary
[One paragraph describing what this ticket delivers]

## Context
[Why this is needed, any relevant background]

## Scope
**In scope:**
- [list of things included]

**Out of scope:**
- [list of things explicitly excluded]

## Implementation Notes
- [Key files to modify]
- [Relevant patterns to follow]
- [Any technical considerations or gotchas]

## Acceptance Criteria
\`\`\`json
{
  "criteria": [
    { "description": "...", "verified": false }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## References
- [Links to Figma, docs, related tickets, PRs]
```

### Step 6: Update the Linear ticket

Show the user the complete description and ask for approval. Once approved:

1. Use the Linear MCP tool to update the ticket description with the generated content.
2. Confirm the update was successful.
3. Report: "Ticket [identifier] is ready for agent execution. Move it to **Todo** when you want an agent to pick it up."

## Tips

- Keep criteria atomic — one thing per criterion
- Reference specific files and components when possible
- If the user mentions something that should be a separate ticket, note it but keep this ticket focused
- The acceptance criteria JSON block is machine-readable — Stokowski agents are instructed to verify each criterion before moving to Human Review
